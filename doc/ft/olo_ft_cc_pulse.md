## Description

This component is a **TMR-hardened pulse clock domain crossing**. A single SEU on any flip-flop
inside the crossing is masked, making the component suitable for pulse-based CDC in
radiation-hardened designs.

This is the fault-tolerant counterpart to [olo_base_cc_pulse](../base/olo_base_cc_pulse.md) with
the same pulse-based semantics. Pulses on `In_Pulse` are converted to pulses on `Out_Pulse`
across the clock domain boundary.

## Detailed Description

### Architecture

The component implements the modified short-pulse synchronizer from Li, Nelson, and Wirthlin [1]
(Fig. 14), triplicated per Fig. 11 of the same paper. Per pulse channel, the design instantiates
three independent copies (A, B, C) of the Li Fig. 14 synchronizer, with a per-bit 2-of-3 majority
voter at the output. The internal topology of each copy is:

```text
                        ┌──────────────── fb ───────────────┐
                        │                                    │
In_Pulse ─> [S  Q] ─> [D FF1 Q] ─(AND ~fb)─> [D FF2 Q] ─> [D FF3 Q] ─┬─> rcvSig
            [R   ] <─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The SR latch (one per TMR copy, per bit) is a level-sensitive latch that converts the input
pulse into a stable level. The level crosses the clock domain through FF1 and FF2, and FF3
(plus optional FF4 for `SyncStages_g = 4`) stretches the output pulse so that the downstream
voter sees sufficient overlap across all three TMR copies under worst-case sampling uncertainty.
The feedback from the last FF resets the latch and simultaneously gates the AND gate, producing
a clean single pulse at the receiver.

### TMR Safety

With the 2-cycle output pulse width (for `SyncStages_g = 3`) combined with the per-bit majority
voter, the design is provably immune to any single SEU on any flip-flop in any of the three
chains, even under worst-case sampling uncertainty between the chains. This has been verified
both analytically and experimentally in [1], showing 6 to 10 orders of magnitude MTTF improvement
over unmitigated designs.

The architecture sets `syn_radhardlevel = "none"` at the architecture level to prevent tools
like Synplify (used by Microchip Libero) from triplicating the already-triplicated registers.

### Timing Constraints

The user must respect these constraints:

1. **Input pulse width**: each input pulse must return to zero before the feedback round-trip
   completes. A single-cycle pulse on `In_Clk` is always safe. A multi-cycle pulse is fine if
   it returns to zero before the feedback arrives back at the SR latch. A sustained level
   signal is **not** supported. Use [olo_ft_cc_bits](./olo_ft_cc_bits.md) for level signals.

2. **Maximum clock ratio**: for the handshake to work correctly, the feedback round-trip time
   must exceed the input pulse duration. Approximately:

   ```text
   f_out < SyncStages_g * f_in
   ```

   For `SyncStages_g = 3` and a single-cycle input pulse, this means `f_out < 3 * f_in`.
   Exceeding this ratio causes the feedback to return while the input pulse is still high,
   creating an S/R conflict in the SR latch. If you need a larger clock ratio, increase
   `SyncStages_g` to 4.

3. **Minimum spacing between consecutive pulses on the same bit**: approximately
   `2 * SyncStages_g + 2` `Out_Clk` cycles. The next pulse must not be issued until the
   feedback handshake is complete (latch reset, feedback de-asserted).

4. **Output pulse width**: `SyncStages_g - 1` `Out_Clk` cycles (2 cycles for `SyncStages_g = 3`,
   3 cycles for `SyncStages_g = 4`). Downstream logic must sample on any cycle while the output
   is high. If a single-cycle pulse is required at the output, add an edge detector on
   `Out_Pulse`.

### Reset Behavior

Reset is crossed between the two clock domains using the TMR-hardened
[olo_ft_cc_reset](./olo_ft_cc_reset.md), consistent with the `olo_base_cc_reset` usage in
`olo_base_cc_pulse`. The resulting synchronized resets (`In_RstOut`, `Out_RstOut`) are exposed
to the user to help with reset management in surrounding logic.

### Synthesis Notes

- The SR latch is an **intentional VHDL latch**. Synthesis tool warnings about latch inference
  on `LatchOut` can be ignored; the latch is a core part of the design.
- `syn_radhardlevel = "none"` prevents vendor TMR from triplicating already-triplicated
  registers. Tools that do not recognize this attribute will simply ignore it.
- Attributes `dont_merge`, `preserve`, `syn_preserve`, `syn_keep`, `dont_touch` are applied to
  prevent the synthesis tool from merging the three TMR copies into a single register chain
  (which would defeat the TMR).
